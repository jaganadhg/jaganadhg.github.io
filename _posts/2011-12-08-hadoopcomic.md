There was a discussion on Hadoop Comic in [Apache Hadoop Mailing list](http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/Hadoop-Comic-td3566916.html). I found that Maneesh Varshney created a wonderful comic strip to describe the entire Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It is quite useful to understand the HDFS in easy way. 
I am sharing the comic at my [Slideshare account](http://www.slideshare.net/jaganadhg/hdfs-10509123). 
Kudos to Maneesh Varshney for the wonderful and creative work.

Here it is .
