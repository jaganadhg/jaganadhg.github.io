As you know I am using free version of the [freeflux.net](freeflux.net) CMS system. So they put some add with each blogpost. Most of my posts were on Python. So the freeflux.net people put add of an IDE for Python called "WingIDE". It is not a free one. Purely commercial. But you can download a trial version from the site [http://wingware.com/products?gclid=CMrp_OLQh50CFQEupAodPR1Lbw](http://wingware.com/products?gclid=CMrp_OLQh50CFQEupAodPR1Lbw.).
They are calling it as "The Intelligent Development Environment for Python Developers".

I just downloaded the trial version of the IDE. Fortunately they provides M$Windows and GNU/Linux version. I downloaded the deb file and installed in my Ubuntu 9.04 for having a feel of it. It is nice tool. Testing and debugging facilities are there. The features are listed here [http://wingware.com/wingide/features](http://wingware.com/wingide/features) . 

If you are a web developer you will get [Zope](http://www.zope.org/) and [Plone](http://plone.org/) support too. Professional Personal and Basic version of the IDE is available.
You will get a tial for 10 days which can be extened up to 10 days. 

It is nice but I uninstalled it. Because I don't have a licence and I cant divorce my [VIM editor](http://plone.org/) .
