Yesterday I was listening Van Lindberg's talk in PyCon US 2011 about [Patent Mining](http://us.pycon.org/2011/schedule/presentations/169/). In his talk he mentioned about the [Yahoo! Term Extractor](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html) Web Service. Before some times I heard that the service is not available now. Again I checked the web site and found that it is working now. I just played with the web service using a simple python script. Soon after seeing that it is working fine i created a dirty Python API for the web service. I am sharing code and documentation here
Code: [https://bitbucket.org/jaganadhg/yahootermextract/overview](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html)
Sample : [https://bitbucket.org/jaganadhg/yahootermextract/wiki/Home](http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html)

After finishing the work I searched in the net and found that some similar scripts are available already :-(
