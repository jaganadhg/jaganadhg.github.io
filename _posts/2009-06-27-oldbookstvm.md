There are so many book stalls in Trivandrum . You can purchase technical books to service books from those book stalls. There will be routine book fairs too. But most of the book lovers will be visting a reguler book fair. That is the Old Book Shops at Thiruvanathapuram. When I came to Thiruvananthapuram in 2000 it was scattered in many parts of the city, east fort, near secreteriate, University Office etcc. The town planners compelled the sellers to change their market place to here and there. Now those shops are located near the Public libraray and University mens hostel. 
From PSC guide to Medical Engineering text books, out of print books are available there. I am going to miss all these views. Because I am moving to Chennai.
