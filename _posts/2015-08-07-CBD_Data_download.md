title: Downloading the Citi Bike Data with Python
--- 

Recently I was thinking about creating a visualization project with R and [Pyxley] (https://github.com/stitchfix/pyxley). I was looking for some cool data and selected the [Citi Bike Data] (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) . The data is available as 24 zip files. I thought of writing a script to fetch the data. Here is the script which I wrote.

Soon I will be back with a cool visualizations on the data.

Happy hacking.
