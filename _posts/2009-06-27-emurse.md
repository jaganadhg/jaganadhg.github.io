 Recently I came across a resume builder tool. It is an online one. If your resume contents are decided login to [Emurse.com](http://www.emurse.com/)  . Fill in the details, select design and download. You can download resume in any format like M$ Word Adobe PDF, ODT, HTML and TXT. Also you will get a resume website like yourname.emurse.com.
