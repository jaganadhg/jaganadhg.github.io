Again I tried to do something in Python3. But it resulted in some strange results. 
See the below given code.

    ==== Code Begin =========

    def ജഗന്‍ ():
        print("എന്റെ പേര് ജഗന്‍ എന്നാണ്")
        ജഗന്‍  = "ഞാന്‍"
        print(ജഗന്‍  )

    ജഗന്‍ ()

==== Code End ===========

When I tried to execute this it throws some error.

    ~/pypract$ python3 tes2.py 
      File "tes2.py", line 2
        def ജഗന്‍ ():
                          ^
    SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier

    ~/pypract$

I thought that it may be due to the use of 'ZWJ' in some names I used in function names and variable names. So I decided to rewrite the same without 'ZWJ' character. The code is given below

    ==== Code Begin =====
    def ജഗന്‍():
        print("എന്റെ പേര് ജഗന്‍ എന്നാണ്")
        ജഗന്‍= "ഞാന്‍"
        print(ജഗന്‍)

    ജഗന്‍()
    ==== Code End =======

This code executed with out any error. What I did is I replaced the ന്‍ with the Unicode 5.1 equivalent .
The output is 

    /pypract$ python3 tester.py
    എന്റെ പേര് ജഗന്‍ എന്നാണ്
    ഞാന്‍

I can't understand what is happening. Is a logical mistake I made in my program!!!
Or is it a problem related to ZWJ and Python????
