[BarCamp Kerala 9](http://www.barcampkerala.org/blog/) held at Amrithapuri Campus kollam on 14 November 2009. This is the first time I am appearing in a BarCamp. I reached the venue around 12.15 PM. I came with my fried Rajeev Raj. When I reached Hiran was explaining about Open Movie and the Sintel movie show was in progress. There was a discussion on open movie and the 'Chamba' project. When they mentioned about 'blender' lots of tweets appeared comparing Maya with Blender. Praseed Pai , Hiran and another guy(I forgot his name) explained about Blender and replied for some question regarding Maya vs Blender. Then everybody went for lunch. The post lunch session started with a talk on Open Street map by Pavithran. Lots of questions came from the audience about the data and its licensing. Even people tried to compare Open Stree tMap with Google maps. In the discussion time I too tried answer questions regarding Google and Open Street Map comparison. The next talk was on PhoneGap an application for building web applications for mobile platform. A group of hackers took a session on Wifi and they did some demo also. It was an informative one. Some people tweeted that it is 12th class lessons. The next session was handled by me on "Practical Machine Learning" . When the next talk was in progress I left the campus. Because I was in a hurry to reach home and return to Coimbatore. 

It was a nice experience and I added some new friends too. If barcamp happens again I will be attending it .
