[Open workbench](http://www.openworkbench.org/) is a project scheduler and project management tool. Again a Ruby based desktop application. Most of the project leaders and managers in the corporate world will be using M$ Project for scheduling and managing there project. Dear leaders and managers have a change!!. Here is an alternative for you "Open Workbench". Everything which you are doing in M$ tool will be available here, some times more. The project is supported by [CA](http://myclarity.com/). If your company would like to reduce licensing cost of M$ Project recommend it and save $$ers. I tried it. Great!!. Before getting the tool I was doing all the thing with M$ tool. (Sorry I compelled to use it. So i searched for an open tool). There was no difficulty in using it. Easy to install and use. No dependency no license ultimate freedom. I used the tool for creating schedules of two projects which i coordinated in my previous organisation.
If you are an open source guy you will ask What about planer? Yes palnner is there. But Open Workbench is more and more advanced one. Have feel of it.
