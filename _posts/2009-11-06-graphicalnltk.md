TODO add images here.

Can you guess from which data this plots are generated ? This is plot of [WordNet](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAgQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwordnet.princeton.edu%2F&rct=j&q=WordNet&ei=JSX0SvqrAZfu6gOtzvAC&usg=AFQjCNETcVpoFxLeOQnnIwKuzNukTQG0Og) relations generated with [NLTK](nltk.org) and Python-networkx library. I got this idea from the [4th cahpter of the book Natural Language Processing with Python](http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch04.html).

The Image _i generated from the synset relation  of the word 'bird' and Image - II from 'language' and Image III from 'Python'. For more information read the book Natural Language Processing with Python.

Happy hacking !!!!!!
