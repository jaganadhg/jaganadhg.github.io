I got an interesting article in the [ACM Communications Oct 2009 issue](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/10). "[Human Interaction for High-Quality Machine Translation](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/10/42489-human-interaction-for-high-quality-machine-translation)" by "Francisco Casacuberta, Jorge Civera, Elsa Cubel, Antonio L. Lagarda, Guy Lapalme, Elliott Macklovitch, Enrique Vidal". 

Nice and informative one.
Don't miss this .
