 [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) the Open Source Project Management tool installation is easy now. A [Bitnami stack](http://bitnami.org/stack/redmine) is available for Redmine now. You can download the stack from Bitnami site and install with in 10 minutes. It is great. I took around two days to install and configure it before. Todat I did it with 10 minutes .

Happy hacking !!!!!!!!!
