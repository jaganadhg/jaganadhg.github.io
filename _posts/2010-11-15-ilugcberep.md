The second meeting of ILUGCBE held at Amritha University, Ettimadai on 14th Nov 2010 . The meeting started by 4.30 PM . The meeting started by a welcome talk by Prof.Adhinarayanan of Amritha University. Kennethe Gonsalves gave a brief introduction about ILUGCEB. After the introduction Jaganadh G gave a talk on "Will FOSS help me to get a job?" . The talk was followed by a small discussion. Prof. Adhinarayanan explained how they are training the students to work on FOSS. Some suggestions were pop up from the audience regarding the same. The next talk was given by Kenneth Gonsalves about Python programming language. We are surprised to see that a couple of Amritha students are good in Python. The next talk was by Sundaram Ramachandran . He started with an intro to FOSS philosophy. Then he switched to the FOSS based development activities in his organization. Both talks were followed by some hot discussions. The meeting ended by 6.15 PM.

Around 50 preople participated in the meeting . We are happy to see that even faculty members from Amrtitha attened the meeting. A good number of students participated in the meeting.
