We (Biju B, Anand Ganeshan, and me) started working in [Openstreetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). [Kenneth Gonsalvas](http://lawgon.livejournal.com/) offered a GPS device (GDL-3204 by Sparc System) for mapping. Initially we started marking shops buildings and some routes. Now my team became familiar with JOSM editor and Potlact. 

We started mapping Ganapathy and Lakshmimills area at Coimbatore. Some of our edits can be viewed below.
