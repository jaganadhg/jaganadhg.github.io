Last Thursday (17th March 2011) I conducted a Python training session at [Kongu Engineering College](http://www.kongu.ac.in/), Perundurai, Erode ad part of the [Infocruise](http://infocruise.org/) program. I got the opportunity through the ILUGC mailing list. Thanks Sreenivasan T. 

I started my Journey from Coimbatore on Thursday morning in a TNSTC bus. I reached Perundurrai by 10.00 A.M. Maharajan student from Kongu and his friend reached the bus stand to pick me up to the college. By 10.15 we reached the college. The college is located in a nice calm and cool place. It is a green campus. After a small refreshment we went to the workshop venue. Around 60 students from different colleges participated in the workshop. The workshop was a partial hands on one. There was some power issues in the lab. So we were not able to do a full fledged hands on session on Python. The students were excited to learn such a simple and elegant programming language. They came up with copuple of interesting question regarding Python Job opportunities, application development etc..

The workshop ended by 4.00 PM. Maharajan dropped me at Perundurai bus stand. I cached a bus to Coimbatore and reached office by 06.30 P.M.

Some snaps (Thanks to Maharajan for sharing the photos)
