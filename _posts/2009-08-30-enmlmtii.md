Yesterday I contacted [Golam](http://anubadok.sourceforge.net/) the developer of "Anubadok" English to Bengali MT system. My previous post was about to start working on the system. I was talking about generating the dictionary for the MT system. Golam suggested me to look in to some more modules.
" Apart from bdict.db, you should also have a look at "lib/Anubadok/BnTable.pm"
and "lib/Anubadok/BnSonshi.pm" modules. These are Bengali (Bn) specific files where you need to change stuffs. "

Ya really we have to look in to those modules. I just opened those two files. BnTable.pm is  for handling grammar and BnSonshi.pm is for Sandhi. For tuning this to some other Indian Languages good knowledge on the grammar system is required. I am studying the code now. Will post more details soon.
Happy Hacking !!!!!!!!
