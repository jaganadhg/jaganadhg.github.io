Packt Publishing provided an e-book of their new book ["MySQL for Python"](http://link.packtpub.com/68ats1) by Albert Lukaszewski. I will be reading the book during my deepavali holidays and I will put a review on the book here. 

They provided link to a free chapter ([Chapter No. 4 - Exception Handling](http://link.packtpub.com/68ats1)) also . If you are interested in Python and MySQL feel free to read it.
