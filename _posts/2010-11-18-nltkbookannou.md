Packt Publishing releases a new book ['Python Text Processing with NLTK 2.0 Cookbook'](http://www.packtpub.com/python-text-processing-nltk-20-cookbook/book) by [Jacob Perkins](http://streamhacker.com). I received review copy of the book today. I will put a review of the book here soon. The book comes with lot of practical examples and tips.

An extracted chapter from the book is available for download at [https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/3609-chapter-3-creating-custom-corpora.pdf](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/3609-chapter-3-creating-custom-corpora.pdf)
