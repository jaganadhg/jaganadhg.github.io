My village Kamukumchury(Belongs to Kollam District Kerala State) too comes in to Openstreetmap. Last week I payed visit to my village . I bought GPS device with me and mapped some parts of my village. Also I traced some roads and marked it. Some roads which passes  through my village was mere straight lines . Based on GPS traces I made correction too .
