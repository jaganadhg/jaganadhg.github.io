Last month I was playing with [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). Just some introductory stuff, map reduce etc... Soon I received some Linguistic data in .cvs format, as part of the project which I was managing. There was a need to analyze it. Usually we used MySQL/Spreadsheets  to store and analyze the data. Suddenly I thought why can't I do it with CouchDB ?? . There was no direct option for import CSV data to CouchDB. I searched in the web and ended with a hint. Manilal a friend of mine also pointed to the same hint [http://www.apacheserver.net/Load-CSV-file-into-couchdb-at1056996.htm](http://www.apacheserver.net/Load-CSV-file-into-couchdb-at1056996.htm) . 

Soon I created a small script to do the job aka load CSV file to CouchDB. The script is available in my Bitbucket repo [https://bitbucket.org/jagan/misc/src/84cefb61c86a/csv2couch.py](https://bitbucket.org/jagan/misc/src/84cefb61c86a/csv2couch.py) . It is a quick solution. May be you may be have a better version !!! I thought putting it in the web may help somebody else.


Happy Hacking !!!
