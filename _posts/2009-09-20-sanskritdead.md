Normally people believes that Sanskrit is a "dead language". But it is not, because it is in use in India as mother tongue. Mother tongue of Mathur village, a village in Karnataka state in India. 

Today I watched an advertisement of Bajaj Discovery bike. Mathur is location of the add. Except some on or two sentence in the add rest of the dialogues are in Sanskrit only!!!!

Being a student of Sanskrit I am excited to see the add with Sanskrit dialogue. I am searching for the youtube version of the add . 

Sanskrit is a living language.
