It is quite long time I updated something in this blog. The reason is Feeflux ended service and I was too lazy to manage a server by my own. Today I realized that Freeflux is till operational. Let me re-start with one big update in life :

We are blessed with a baby boy and named him Vaidyanadh. Spending leisure with him :-)

Will be updating more technical stuff here soon .

Migrated from my [old blog jaganadhg.freeflux.net] (https://web.archive.org/web/20160323193721/http://jaganadhg.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2015/01/15/life-update.html)
