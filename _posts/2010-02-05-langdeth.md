I saw a shocking news in today's Hindu news paper "[Andamanese tribes, languages die](http://bit.ly/9u8WOZ)".

One more language vanishes the [Great Andamanese languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andamanese_languages) . 

As per the [UNESCO Worldâ€™s Languages in Danger](http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=002) thre are 5 native speakers of the language in 2007 . But the Hindu news says that the last speaker also passed away. The language too. Fortunately some documentation is there says the news.
