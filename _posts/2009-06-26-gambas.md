 I was reading [Shibu Varkalas blog](http://shibuvarkala.blogspot.com/). I came across posting related to anew Open Source Development Environment called ["Gambas"](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html). It can replace Visual Basic of M$. But it is not a clone of M$ VB.  The gambas site narrates its features as followes
" With Gambas, you can quickly design your program GUI with QT or GTK+, access MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, ODBC and SQLite databases, pilot KDE applications with DCOP, translate your program into any language, create network applications easily, make 3D OpenGL applications, make CGI web applications, and so on...
"  
I downloaded a [beautifull open book on Gambas programming](http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html).  After reading the boob my friend who is familier with Visual Studio told that it is easy to migrate from VB to Gambas. Syllabus designers who introduces VB please incorporate this tool in your syllabus. 
I am moving from my current organization in the next week so I am busy with finishing ded lines. Will try the tool and post more details soon.
Also my friend agreed that he will try it soon. If he suceed in it I will post the result. My friend is novice in GNU/Linux :-).
